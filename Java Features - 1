Support for TCP, UDP, and basic Socket communication is excellent

Transmission Control Protocol [TCP]

Java is  Portable:

We can write a program and run it on all of the platforms

This .class file[Byte Code] is common for all platforms.

Platform: OS + Processor:
OS: 32 Bit / 64 Bit OS:
Processor: Speed:

Binary Digits: Bit:
