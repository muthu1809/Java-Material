Architecture Neutral:
byte code is independent of the underlying platform that the program is running on

from .java to .class file:



32 Bit / 64 Bit OS:

"Portable" means that a program written to run on one operating system works on another operating system without changing anything.

Platform Independence:

Platform: Combination of Software and Hardware:
                         OS and Processor

.java program to .class file.
.class file to binary

Compilation = Translation

Compilers for every OS is expensive --> C++.

Compilation:
Converting our .java programs into .class file is known as Compilation.


Compile Time:
Time taken for Converting our .java programs into .class file is known as Compilation Time or Compile Time

.class files are Platform Independent files.  This .class file is generated by Java Development Kit [JDK].

JDK: Java Development Kit:
JDK will do Error Checking, Exception Handling Mechanisms.

Java Runtime Environment[JRE] will take this .class file.
Inside JRE, we have Java Virtual Machine[JVM].

JVM converts .class file[Byte Code] to binary code[0,1s]. A Compiler known as JIT Compiler does this conversion.

JIT: Just In Time

JIT Compiler is an Interpreter:

Interpreter: வரிபெயர்ப்பி: Line by line translation


JVM Converts this based on Platform.
JVM is Platform Dependent.

Write Once Run Anywhere [WORA]
Compile Once Run Anywhere [CORA]


Java is Secured:
Only JRE can execute our .class files.

Java is Multithreaded Language:
JavaScript is single threaded language:
Parallel Execution of Multiple Java programs
Concurrent

Await, Async

Multiprocessing: Processes:

Thread:

Java is OOP:
